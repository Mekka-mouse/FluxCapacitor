# FluxCapacitor ⚡

Welcome to **FluxCapacitor**, my launchpad into the world of development. Just like its namesake, this repository isn’t just about possibility. A beginner's dev vault powered by 1.21 gigawatts of curiosity and caffeine and a bit of calamity. This is where future full-stack legends begin their time-traveling journey through the wild world of code.

## 🧭 What’s Inside?
Whether you're a Padawan of programming or a Biff-beating beginner, this repo is your personal DeLorean: it may look like humble metal on the outside, but under the hood, it's capable of amazing things.<br>
<br>This is a beginner-friendly space for:
- 🛠️ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practice projects  
- 📚 Notes and resources to build solid foundations  
- 🧪 Tiny experiments to test your coding flux  
- 🤓 Annotated code to help make sense of the madness

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FluxCapacitor.git
2. Open up a folder - HTML, JavaScript, or Mini-Projects - and start the journey.
3. Commit early, commit often...don't worry, you won't mess up the timeline (I don't think).
